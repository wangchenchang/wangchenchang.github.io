Welcome to my home page. I will record my solutions to some small problems in my research and study and my thoughts on some research contents in my blog. I hope I can keep recording this road of learning and acquire the ability of independent thinking and autonomous learning in the process of learning.
If my records can be of some help to the readers of my homepage, I am very honored. I also welcome those who are interested in what I study to discuss with me. I hope everyone can make progress together and work hard together
